### Some areas to improve
There are certain parts of the website that I have not created in a proper manner and just applied some quick fix to make it work. Should investigate on how to fix them with a better logic

- The third part of the sidebar. Was not able to put it in a proper place so threw in few extra elements so that it looks fine

- The profile pic needs to be an image

- better way to scale the font

- Trending section (bottom right) is still remaining
